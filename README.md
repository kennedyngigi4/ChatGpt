# ChatGPT exploration

ChatGPT offers a range of benefits to developers and companies. In this repository I am going to explore on:  
1. How I can boost my productivity as a developer with ChatGPT
2. How I can help my team improve their productivity as well.


In a nutshell I am going to explore ways in which we can be more creative and efficient in achieving our company goals.

#Chat Completion

This API endpoint can be very helpful to companies and developers in various industries. 

With a better user interface and backend that is restricted to a specific context in which the company operates, Chat Completion API can be used as a Chatbot for users interaction. In few lines as demonstrated in my file #chat.py one can get responses from the A.I related to sports management.
